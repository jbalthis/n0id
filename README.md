<p>This application is designed to provide the end user with a means of having truly private messaging on their mobile device. The cryptographic messaging capability is supplied via the RC4 stream cipher, which results in 256-bit encryption and is based on the theory of preshared keys. Currently, the app is still being tested and debugged, but it will be available in the app stores soon! Stay tuned for more details.</p>
